## My process

->First i work upon the structure like how will i design it and then wrote the particular HTML related to it.

->then worked on each div in the css that took me like hours but i get there after some try.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 5
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Recaped my HTML

.proud-of-this-css {
display: flex;
flex-flow: column-reverse;
}

### Continued development

I would love to work on flexbox and responsiveness in the near future, i'm not good in this but still i feel comfortable to work upon it.
